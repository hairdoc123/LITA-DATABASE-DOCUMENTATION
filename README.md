# LITA-DATABASE-DOCUMENTATION
This is where i document my first project while learning Data Analysis with the  incubator Hub.

## Project Title: My Data Analysis Learning Process

### Project Overview
This Data analysis aims to generate insight into how to create Database, create table, add record to my table

### Data Sources
The primary source of Data used during my learning process is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online as kaggle

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
  
    i. For data cleaning
  
    ii. For Analysis
  
    iii. For Visualization
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Quering of data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

 ## Data Cleaning and Preparation
 In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following;
 
  i. Data loadind and inspection
  
  ii. Handling missing variables
  
  iii. Data cleaning and formating

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis
